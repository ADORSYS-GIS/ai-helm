description: This is an umbrella chart and acts as the main entry point for deploying the entire Lightbridge authorization system. It doesn’t have any templates of its own but instead manages the deployment of the lightbridge-authz and lightbridge-config charts as its dependencies. This chart is used to define the global configurations and to enable or disable the sub-charts as needed, providing a single point of control for the entire application stack.
